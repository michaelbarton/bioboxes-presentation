1	# Title slide
69	# Part 1 - Introduction
19	# JGI sequences many organisms
22	# Genome assembly as part of sequencing process
9	# A lot of software published about assembly
70	# Have to compare assemblers from the literature
71	# Example comparison is contiguity of the assembly
72	# Repeat for new assemblers
73	# Boring repetitive work
74	# Part 2 - Automating software benchmarking
8	# Problems with benchmarking bioinformatics software
10	# Can't find software
11	# ./configure; make; make install
12	# Exploding software
13	# Producing poor results
75	# solution to bioinformatics software problems
31	# Put software in docker containers
76	# Solves versioning, accessiblity, bundled pipelines
47	# Bioboxes
48	# What is a biobox?
43	# Function specification
44	# Fastq function specification
45	# function specification applied to assembly
56	# Test this specification
77	# User interfaces are important
51	# Bang!
52	# Running velvet
52	# Running megahit
54	# Running megahit with SHA256
78	# How is biobox executed
49	# How bioboxes works
79	# Docker as a backend
59	# what value does this provide
60	# don't have to rewire the whole system
