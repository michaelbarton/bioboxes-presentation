1	# Title slide
69	# Part 1 - Introduction
19	# JGI sequences many organisms
22	# Genome assembly as part of sequencing process
9	# A lot of software published about assembly
70	# Have to compare assemblers from the literature
71	# Example comparison is contiguity of the assembly
72	# Repeat for new assemblers
73	# Boring repetitive work
74	# Part 2 - Automating software benchmarking
8	# Problems with benchmarking bioinformatics software
10	# Can't find software
11	# ./configure; make; make install
12	# Exploding software
13	# Producing poor results
75	# solution to bioinformatics software problems
31	# Put software in docker containers
76	# Solves versioning, accessiblity, bundled pipelines
47	# Bioboxes
48	# What is a biobox?
43	# Function specification
44	# Fastq function specification
46	# function specification applied to assembly
56	# Test this specification
77	# User interfaces are important
51	# Bang!
52	# Running velvet
53	# Running megahit
54	# Running megahit with SHA256
78	# How is biobox executed
49	# How bioboxes works
79	# Docker as a backend
59	# what value does this provide
60	# don't have to rewire the whole system
66	# Publications to testable containers
33	# Automate process over a large number of genomes
80	# Benchmarking process overview
81	# Implementation on AWS
82	# Append only database
88	# Example JSON payload for task
89	# Clojure code example
83	# TODO
84	# Large matrix of comparison results
89	# Statistics about data size
37	# Example large range of values
85	# Part 3
86	# What to do with the large matrix
87	# Compute values for each assembler
35	# Select best assembler based on performance
88	# Estimate value for each assembler
89	# Model structure
90	# Estimate coefficients
91	# Poisson-like values
92	# Model selection
93	# BIC
94	# Null model
95	# Genome null
96	# Genome and assembler effect
97	# Compare arguments vs versions
98	# Different variance structures
99	# Model implementation
100	# Model YML
101	# Parallel model fitting
102	# Processor usage
103	# Model checking
104	# NA50 model fitting
105	# Misassembly model fitting
106	# Misassembly model fitting
107	# Indel model fitting
108	# annotations as a proxy
109	# L1 norm model fitting
84	# Revisit - Large matrix of comparison results
110	# Part 4 - Summary
64	# Problems with bioinformatics software
24	# Hard to compare publications
25	# confirmation bias
66	# Standardisation of interfaces
